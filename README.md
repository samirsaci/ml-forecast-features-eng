Based on the feedback of the last Makridakis Forecasting Competitions, Machine Learning models can **reduce the forecasting error by 20% to 60% compared to
benchmark statistical models.**

Their major advantage is the capacity to include external features that heavily impact the variability of your sales.

For example, e-commerce cosmetics sales are driven by ***special events** (promotions) and on how you **advertise a reference on the website** (first page, second page, â€¦).

This process called **features engineering** is based on **analytical concepts and business insights** to understand what could drive your sales.

### Article
In this [Article](https://s-saci95.medium.com/machine-learning-for-retail-sales-forecasting-features-engineering-4edfee7c9cbc), will try to understand the impact of 
several features on the accuracy of a model using the M5 Forecasting competition dataset.

### Experiment
Based on business insights or common sense, we will add additional features, built with existing ones, to help our model to capture all the key factors 
impacting your customer demand.
